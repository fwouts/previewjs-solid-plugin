# SolidJS plugin for Preview.js

This is a plugin for [Preview.js](https://previewjs.com) that adds support for previewing SolidJS components.

This includes:

- detecting SolidJS components (and Storybook stories)
- previewing them with instant refresh
- extracting their props types to let Preview.js auto-generate valid properties for them
- configuring custom previews [similarly to React](https://previewjs.com/docs/features/custom-previews)

## Try it

This will be released in [Preview.js](https://previewjs.com) v1.6.0 on Wed 6 April 2022.

It may only be available a few days later on IntelliJ/WebStorm due to JetBrain approval delays.
